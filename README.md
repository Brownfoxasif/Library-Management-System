# Library-Management-System

E-Library Management System is an application which refers to library systems which are
generally small or medium in size. It is used by librarian to manage the library using a
computerized system where he/she can add new books, videos and Page sources.

Books and student maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep
track of the students using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library
contains. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record or member record
which generally happens when a non-computerized system is used.
